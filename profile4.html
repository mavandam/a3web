      <h2>Experience and projects</h2>
      <p>I have experience working on a number of projects using different remote sensing technologies. These include unmanned aerial systems (UAS), photogrammetry, LiDAR, underwater acoustics, and satellite imagery along with ground control surveys. </p>
      <img src="images/buffer3.jpg", alt="artic"></div>
      <p>Some projects I have worked on include creating Global Time-Series Climate Maps where climate variables carbon monoxide, chlorophyll and aerosol size were mapped as function of time. Furthermore I have utilized Lidar and spectrometers to calculate the depth of snowpack in the Artic. </p>
      <p>I enjoy mapping soil types for agricultural planning. I have assisted farmers to quantify crop conditions through the use of NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) as well as monitored surface water for their crops. </p> 
      <p> I have been apart of a team conducting Natural Disaster Hazard Analysis. Pipeline leak detection utilizing high-resolution satellite imagery was a key component of this project as well as studying the extent to which buildings were damaged due to flooding.</p>
